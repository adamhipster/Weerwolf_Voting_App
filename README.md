## Weerwolf Voting App

For personal projects I code in a mix of English and Dutch. Sorry guys O:)

To start the app
```
node server.js
```

Open it the app at `http://localhost/stem`, which allows you to vote :)

Adding names can be down as follows, type:
```
http://localhost/names=monkey,sloth,wallabee
```
3 players are now added with the names: monkey, sloth and wallabee
